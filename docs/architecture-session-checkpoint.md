# Architecture Session Checkpoint - 2025-08-05

## Session Progress Status

**Template Used:** Fullstack Architecture Document v2.0  
**Output Target:** `docs/architecture.md`  
**Agent:** Winston (Architect)  
**Approach:** Interactive workflow with mandatory user feedback

## Completed Sections

### ✅ 1. Introduction
- **Status:** Complete with user approval
- **Key Decision:** Brownfield iOS project with existing PM5 BLE foundation
- **Approach:** Build upon existing iOS structure rather than greenfield

### ✅ 2. High Level Architecture  
- **Status:** Complete with user approval
- **Key Decision:** "Individual Excellence First + Proper Foundation" strategy
- **MVP Focus:** Perfect individual athlete experience before coach features
- **Foundation:** Proper time-series infrastructure from day one

### ✅ 3. Tech Stack
- **Status:** Complete with user approval  
- **Key Decisions:**
  - Swift/SwiftUI with Test-Driven Development
  - CloudFormation for IaC (user preference over Terraform)
  - 80%+ test coverage requirement
  - Focus on MVP technologies with Phase 2 growth path

### ✅ 4. Data Models
- **Status:** Complete with user approval
- **Key Models:** Athlete, Session, PerformanceMetric, PM5Device
- **Approach:** TypeScript interfaces for cross-platform consistency

### ✅ 5. MAJOR ARCHITECTURE REVISION
- **Critical Decision:** Hybrid CloudKit + Real-Time approach
- **User Insight:** "Why not use Swift/SwiftUI with CloudKit instead of backend?"
- **Final Architecture:** 
  - MVP: Pure CloudKit for simplicity and zero backend costs
  - Phase 2: Add real-time WebSocket layer for coach monitoring
  - Best of both worlds: CloudKit development speed + real-time capability

### ✅ 6. Updated Data Models (CloudKit Schema)
- **Status:** Complete with hybrid approach
- **Key Decision:** CloudKit records for persistence + WebSocket messages for real-time

### ✅ 7. API Specification
- **Status:** Complete 
- **Key Decision:** Minimal WebSocket API for real-time, CloudKit handles all persistence
- **Approach:** 90% CloudKit native APIs, 10% custom real-time streaming

## Next Section to Resume

**Current Position:** Ready to proceed to **Components** section

**Next Steps:**
1. Define iOS components (BLE manager, data parsers, UI components)
2. Define minimal real-time backend components  
3. Create component interaction diagrams
4. Continue through remaining sections systematically

## Key Architectural Decisions Made

1. **Hybrid CloudKit + Real-Time Architecture**
   - MVP: CloudKit only (zero backend complexity)
   - Phase 2: Add WebSocket layer for coach monitoring
   - No data migration needed between phases

2. **Individual Excellence First**
   - MVP focuses solely on athlete experience
   - Coach features deliberately moved to Phase 2
   - Proves core value before scaling complexity

3. **Risk Mitigation Strategy**
   - Start with proper time-series foundation (no technical debt)
   - Use CloudKit for rapid MVP development
   - Real-time infrastructure ready but dormant until needed

4. **Technology Preferences**
   - Swift/SwiftUI with TDD approach
   - CloudFormation over Terraform
   - Native iOS experience prioritized

## User Feedback Patterns

- Strong preference for native iOS solutions
- Excellent insight on CloudKit vs backend complexity
- Focus on risk mitigation through phased approach
- Emphasis on proper foundations to avoid technical debt

## Resume Command

When ready to continue:
```
Winston, let's resume the architecture document creation. We left off having completed the API Specification section and are ready to proceed to the Components section.
```

## Files Created/Updated

- This checkpoint: `docs/architecture-session-checkpoint.md`
- Target output: `docs/architecture.md` (in progress, not yet written)

---

**Session paused at:** 2025-08-05  
**Estimated completion:** ~60% through full architecture document  
**Remaining sections:** Components, Database Schema, Frontend Architecture (simplified), Development Workflow, Deployment, Security, Testing Strategy, Coding Standards, Error Handling, Monitoring

The hybrid CloudKit + real-time architecture is a solid foundation that balances MVP simplicity with future scalability. Looking forward to completing this comprehensive architecture document!

# Summary

This architecture provides a robust foundation for the Rowing Performance Tracking Platform with:

1. **Broad Device Compatibility** - iOS 15+ supporting iPhone 6S and newer (2015+)
2. **Existing PM5 BLE Implementation** - Leverages proven connectivity code
3. **Hybrid CloudKit + Backend** - Simple MVP with growth path
4. **Self-Hosted to Cloud Migration** - Start cheap (~$50/month), scale when needed
5. **Container-Based Portability** - Same code everywhere
6. **Linear Project Integration** - Automated workflow management
7. **Device-Aware Performance** - Graceful degradation for older hardware
8. **Comprehensive Testing** - Including device compatibility tests
9. **Production-Ready Security** - Industry standard practices

The architecture prioritizes:
- **Accessibility**: Support for 7-8 year old hand-me-down devices
- **MVP Speed**: CloudKit + existing BLE code for rapid deployment
- **Cost Efficiency**: Self-hosted backend option (~$50/month)
- **Scalability**: Clear migration path to cloud
- **Developer Experience**: Modern tooling and automation
- **User Experience**: Native iOS performance with device-appropriate features

## Device Support Matrix
| Device | Year | iOS Version | Performance Tier | Features |
|--------|------|-------------|------------------|----------|
| iPhone 6S/SE 1st | 2015-2016 | iOS 15-16 | Basic | Simplified metrics, 1s updates |
| iPhone 7/8 | 2016-2017 | iOS 15-16 | Standard | Most features, some reduced complexity |
| iPhone X+ | 2017+ | iOS 15+ | Full | All features, full performance |

Next steps:
1. Complete iOS app MVP with iOS 15 compatibility
2. Deploy TestFlight beta targeting older devices
3. Set up self-hosted backend infrastructure
4. Implement coach dashboard
5. Test on variety of device generations
6. Gradual migration to cloud as usage grows

# Story 1.1: Project Setup and iOS App Initialization

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the project repository and iOS app foundation,
**so that** we have a properly structured codebase ready for feature development.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Monorepo created with folders for ios-app, web-dashboard, backend-services, and shared-types
2. iOS app initialized using Swift/SwiftUI with minimum iOS 15 deployment target
3. Git repository initialized with .gitignore for iOS, Node.js, and common IDE files
4. Basic SwiftUI app runs successfully showing "Rowing Performance Tracker" home screen
5. README.md created with project overview, setup instructions, and architecture diagram
6. Package dependencies configured (Swift Package Manager for iOS)
7. Development environment setup documented for new developers
8. Basic app icon and launch screen placeholder added
9. Xcode project configured with appropriate build settings and signing

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the project, building upon existing PM5 BLE implementation code that's already present in the repository.

### Technical Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/introduction.md]
- **Project Status:** Brownfield iOS project with existing PM5 BLE implementation
- **Existing Foundation:** Complete PM5 BLE controller implementation in `d_n_w/PM5/` directory
- **Existing Assets:** CSAFE protocol parser, data models for PM5 metrics, test view for connectivity

[Source: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md]
- **Repository Structure:** Monorepo with clear package boundaries
- **Monorepo Organization:**
  ```
  rowing-platform/
  ├── d_n_w/                 # iOS app (existing)
  ├── backend/               # Self-hosted backend (Phase 2)
  ├── shared/               # Shared types/protocols
  └── docs/                 # Architecture/API docs
  ```

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Frontend Language:** Swift 5.5+
- **Frontend Framework:** SwiftUI + UIKit Hybrid for iOS 15+
- **Device Support:** iOS 15.0+ (iPhone 6S+ - supports 2015+ devices)
- **State Management:** Combine + @Published (built-in, iOS 15 compatible)
- **Build Tool:** Xcode Build 14.0+ with iOS 15 targeting
- **UI Components:** Native SwiftUI/UIKit for platform consistency

### File Locations and Project Structure
Based on existing project structure and architecture requirements:
- **iOS App Location:** `d_n_w/` (existing location to be preserved)
- **Future Backend:** `backend/` (placeholder for Phase 2)
- **Shared Types:** `shared/` (for common data models and protocols)
- **Documentation:** `docs/` (existing location with architecture docs)

### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Testing Framework:** XCTest (native, integrated)
- **Coverage Target:** 80% coverage target for iOS testing
- **Test Types:** Unit tests for core functionality, device compatibility tests
- **Test Structure:** Tests should validate PM5 integration and device compatibility

### Technical Constraints
- **iOS Version:** Minimum iOS 15.0 deployment target (supports older devices like iPhone 6S)
- **Swift Version:** 5.5+ required for modern SwiftUI features
- **Device Support:** Must support devices from 2015+ (hand-me-downs common among students)
- **Architecture Pattern:** MVVM pattern with SwiftUI views and ViewModels

### Testing
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- **Test Framework:** XCTest (native iOS testing framework)
- **Test File Location:** Tests should be in standard Xcode test targets
- **Coverage Requirement:** 80% code coverage target
- **Testing Patterns:** 
  - Unit tests for individual components
  - Device compatibility tests for older device support
  - Integration tests for PM5 BLE connectivity
- **Mock Strategy:** Use XCTest mocking capabilities for BLE testing

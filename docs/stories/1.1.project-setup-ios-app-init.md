**Potential Concerns Addressed:**
1. **Scope Creep**: While PM5 implementation exceeds Story 1.1 scope, it provides foundation for Epic 2
2. **File Organization**: PM5 emulator in root directory (not in ios-app) - acceptable for reference tool
3. **Documentation**: Additional PM5 docs properly placed in docs/ directory

#### üèÜ Final Re-Validation Verdict

**RE-VALIDATION STATUS: ‚úÖ APPROVED - STORY REMAINS COMPLETE**

All original Story 1.1 acceptance criteria remain fully satisfied after recent code changes. The additional PM5 implementation represents value-added development that:
- Does not break any existing functionality
- Maintains proper monorepo structure
- Follows established architecture patterns
- Provides foundation for upcoming Epic 2 stories

**Recommendation**: 
1. **Update Story Status to "Done"** - All ACs verified and maintained
2. **Proceed with Story 1.2** - Foundation remains solid for CI/CD implementation
3. **Note for Epic 2**: PM5 foundation work already completed will accelerate Epic 2 delivery

### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Testing Framework**: XCTest (native iOS testing framework)
- **Coverage Target**: 80% code coverage minimum
- **Test Types**: Unit tests, device compatibility tests, UI tests for critical flows
- **Mock Strategy**: Use XCTest mocking capabilities for BLE testing
- **Test Structure**: Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **TDD Approach**: Follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle for all new features
- **Test Organization**: Unit tests in `ProjectNameTests/`, UI tests in `ProjectNameUITests/`
- **Test Naming**: Format `test_methodName_condition_expectedResult`
- **Coverage Requirements**: 90% unit test coverage minimum

### SwiftLint Configuration Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Configuration File**: `.swiftlint.yml` with specific project rules
- **Key Rules**: Line length 120/140, identifier naming, complexity limits
- **Opt-in Rules**: empty_count, trailing_newline, colon, comma
- **Quality Gates**: Zero error-level violations, maximum 5 warnings per file
- **Enforcement**: Must pass `swiftlint lint --strict` for story completion

### Mock PM5 Service Specifications
[Source: existing PM5 implementation in ios-app/d_n_w/PM5/]
- **Existing PM5Controller**: Core Bluetooth implementation available
- **Mock Requirements**: Match existing PM5Controller interface
- **CSAFE Protocol**: Mock should simulate CSAFE response parsing
- **Test Data**: Generate realistic workout metrics for testing
- **Configuration**: Allow configurable success/failure scenarios

### CI/CD Pipeline Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md]
- **Trigger Events**: Run on every PR creation and updates
- **Branch Strategy**: Runs against feature branches targeting main
- **Build Environment**: GitHub Actions with appropriate Xcode version
- **Deployment**: Create test builds for iOS (not production deployment)

### Technical Constraints
- **iOS Version**: Minimum iOS 15.0 deployment target
- **Xcode Version**: 14.0+ for iOS 15 targeting and build compatibility
- **Swift Version**: 5.5+ for modern SwiftUI and async/await support
- **Device Support**: Must work on iPhone 6S+ devices (2015+)

### Testing
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- **Test Framework**: XCTest (native iOS testing framework)
- **Test File Location**: Tests should be in `ios-app/d_n_wTests/` and `ios-app/d_n_wUITests/`
- **Coverage Requirement**: 80% minimum code coverage with CI enforcement
- **Testing Patterns**: 
  - Follow TDD approach (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle)
  - Use AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
  - Test naming: `test_methodName_condition_expectedResult`
  - Unit tests for individual components
  - Integration tests for PM5 BLE mock service
  - UI tests for critical workflows
- **Mock Strategy**: Create mock PM5 service implementing existing PM5Controller interface
- **Coverage Reporting**: Configure Xcode to generate coverage reports, integrate with CI

# Story 1.2: CI/CD Pipeline and Testing Framework

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** automated testing and deployment pipelines configured,
**so that** we maintain code quality and can deploy reliably.

3. SwiftLint configured with agreed-upon style rules
4. Test coverage reporting implemented with 80% threshold enforcement
5. Automated build process creates test builds for iOS
6. Mock PM5 BLE service created for testing without physical hardware
7. Documentation for running tests locally
8. Pipeline fails if tests fail or coverage drops below 80%

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 completion:
- Project successfully restructured into monorepo with iOS app in `ios-app/` directory
- Xcode project located at `ios-app/d_n_w.xcodeproj`
- Basic iOS app foundation completed with SwiftUI navigation structure
- Existing PM5 BLE implementation available in `ios-app/d_n_w/PM5/` directory
- Test targets already exist: `d_n_wTests/` and `d_n_wUITests/`

### Technical Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **CI/CD Platform**: GitHub Actions (Latest)
- **iOS Testing Framework**: XCTest (Latest, native)
- **Build Tool**: Xcode Build 14.0+ with iOS 15 targeting
- **Coverage Target**: 80% code coverage target for iOS testing

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Swift Version**: 5.5+ (iOS 15 compatible)
- **iOS Deployment Target**: 15.0+ (iPhone 6S+ device support)
- **Testing Framework**: XCTest (native, integrated)
- **Linting Tool**: SwiftLint (configured for project standards)

### File Locations and Project Structure
Based on monorepo structure from Story 1.1:
- **iOS App Location**: `ios-app/d_n_w/`
- **Xcode Project**: `ios-app/d_n_w.xcodeproj`
- **Test Targets**: `ios-app/d_n_wTests/`, `ios-app/d_n_wUITests/`
- **GitHub Actions**: `.github/workflows/` (project root)
- **SwiftLint Config**: `ios-app/.swiftlint.yml`
- **PM5 Implementation**: `ios-app/d_n_w/PM5/` (existing code available)

### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- **Testing Framework**: XCTest (native iOS testing framework)
- **Coverage Target**: 80% code coverage minimum
- **Test Types**: Unit tests, device compatibility tests, UI tests for critical flows
- **Mock Strategy**: Use XCTest mocking capabilities for BLE testing
- **Test Structure**: Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **TDD Approach**: Follow RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle for all new features
- **Test Organization**: Unit tests in `ProjectNameTests/`, UI tests in `ProjectNameUITests/`
- **Test Naming**: Format `test_methodName_condition_expectedResult`
- **Coverage Requirements**: 90% unit test coverage minimum

### SwiftLint Configuration Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Configuration File**: `.swiftlint.yml` with specific project rules
- **Key Rules**: Line length 120/140, identifier naming, complexity limits
- **Opt-in Rules**: empty_count, trailing_newline, colon, comma
- **Quality Gates**: Zero error-level violations, maximum 5 warnings per file
- **Enforcement**: Must pass `swiftlint lint --strict` for story completion

### Mock PM5 Service Specifications
[Source: existing PM5 implementation in ios-app/d_n_w/PM5/]
- **Existing PM5Controller**: Core Bluetooth implementation available
- **Mock Requirements**: Match existing PM5Controller interface
- **CSAFE Protocol**: Mock should simulate CSAFE response parsing
- **Test Data**: Generate realistic workout metrics for testing
- **Configuration**: Allow configurable success/failure scenarios

### CI/CD Pipeline Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/development-workflow.md]
- **Trigger Events**: Run on every PR creation and updates
- **Branch Strategy**: Runs against feature branches targeting main
- **Build Environment**: GitHub Actions with appropriate Xcode version
- **Deployment**: Create test builds for iOS (not production deployment)

### Technical Constraints
- **iOS Version**: Minimum iOS 15.0 deployment target
- **Xcode Version**: 14.0+ for iOS 15 targeting and build compatibility
- **Swift Version**: 5.5+ for modern SwiftUI and async/await support
- **Device Support**: Must work on iPhone 6S+ devices (2015+)

### Testing
**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- **Test Framework**: XCTest (native iOS testing framework)
- **Test File Location**: Tests should be in `ios-app/d_n_wTests/` and `ios-app/d_n_wUITests/`
- **Coverage Requirement**: 80% minimum code coverage with CI enforcement
- **Testing Patterns**: 
  - Follow TDD approach (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle)
  - Use AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
  - Test naming: `test_methodName_condition_expectedResult`
  - Unit tests for individual components
  - Integration tests for PM5 BLE mock service
  - UI tests for critical workflows
- **Mock Strategy**: Create mock PM5 service implementing existing PM5Controller interface
- **Coverage Reporting**: Configure Xcode to generate coverage reports, integrate with CI

# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Enable rowing coaches to monitor real-time performance data from multiple athletes simultaneously during training sessions
- Provide athletes with enhanced real-time performance feedback including power output (watts) and stroke rate flow visualization on their personal iOS devices
- Automate data collection from Concept2 PM5 rowing machines via BLE connectivity with 95%+ reliability
- Eliminate manual data entry, saving coaches 2+ hours per week on administrative tasks
- Ensure correct machine pairing in busy boathouses with 90%+ accuracy on first attempt
- Store all session data in cloud infrastructure for historical analysis and performance tracking
- Support team/crew performance analysis for data-driven lineup decisions
- Deliver MVP to pilot school within 3 months using test-driven development methodology
- Achieve 80% daily active usage during rowing season within pilot program

## Background Context
The rowing community faces a significant gap between the rich performance data available from modern rowing machines and the ability to effectively capture, analyze, and act on this data at a team level. Concept2 PM5 monitors generate comprehensive metrics but this data remains isolated on individual machines. Coaches resort to manual methods that are time-consuming and error-prone, while athletes miss opportunities for real-time technique improvements beyond what the PM5 display shows.

This PRD defines requirements for an iOS-first platform that bridges this gap through automated BLE data collection, real-time streaming to both athlete devices and coach dashboards, and cloud-based analytics. By focusing on the specific needs of school rowing teams and clubs, we can deliver a solution that transforms how rowing programs train and make performance decisions.

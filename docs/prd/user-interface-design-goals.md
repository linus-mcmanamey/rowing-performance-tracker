# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Create an intuitive, distraction-free experience that enhances training without interfering with it. Athletes should glance at real-time metrics without breaking rowing rhythm. Coaches should monitor multiple athletes effortlessly, spotting issues and opportunities instantly. The design prioritizes clarity, speed, and essential information over feature richness.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Zero-friction connection**: QR scan or tap-to-connect with visual confirmation
- **Glanceable metrics**: Large, high-contrast displays optimized for exercise conditions
- **Gesture-based controls**: Swipe to navigate between metric views while rowing
- **Grid-based monitoring**: Coach dashboard uses familiar spreadsheet-like layout
- **Progressive disclosure**: Advanced metrics available but not overwhelming beginners
- **Status-first design**: Connection state, sync status always visible
- **Touch-friendly targets**: All interactive elements sized for use during exercise

## Core Screens and Views
- **Connection Screen**: QR scanner, machine list, connection status
- **Athlete Real-time View**: Primary metrics display with watts, stroke rate, splits
- **Athlete Session Summary**: Post-workout analysis with graphs and progress
- **Coach Dashboard**: Grid view of all active athletes with real-time updates
- **Team Management**: Roster creation, athlete assignment, role management
- **Session History**: Searchable list of past sessions with filters
- **Athlete Profile**: Personal records, progress trends, session history
- **Settings Screen**: Account management, display preferences, connection settings

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
The app will meet WCAG AA standards with high contrast modes, VoiceOver support, and adjustable text sizes. Critical for coaches who may have varying vision needs and for inclusive team environments.

## Branding
Clean, modern athletic aesthetic that doesn't distract from data. School/club customization limited to team colors and logos in designated areas. Focus on performance data visualization rather than decorative elements.

## Target Device and Platforms: iOS Native + Web Responsive
- iOS app optimized for iPhone 11+ (primary athlete interface)
- Web dashboard responsive for laptop/desktop (primary coach interface)
- Future consideration for iPad-specific coach experience

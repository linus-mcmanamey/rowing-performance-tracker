# Epic 4: Data Persistence & Synchronization

Implement reliable data storage in the cloud with offline capabilities and automatic synchronization. This epic ensures no training data is lost and provides the foundation for historical analysis and progress tracking.

## Story 4.1: Cloud Storage Infrastructure

As a developer,
I want to implement time-series data storage,
so that all rowing performance data is reliably persisted.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: ClickHouse database provisioned on AWS
2: Optimized schema for rowing time-series data
3: Data ingestion service handles high-volume writes
4: Partitioning strategy for efficient queries
5: Data retention policies configured
6: Backup and recovery procedures documented
7: Performance testing with 100+ concurrent streams
8: Monitoring and alerting configured
9: Cost optimization for storage growth

## Story 4.2: Offline Mode Implementation

As an athlete,
I want my session data saved locally when offline,
so that I don't lose workouts due to connectivity issues.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Local SQLite database for iOS app
2: Session data cached during network outage
3: Visual indicator shows offline mode active
4: Queue system for pending uploads
5: Automatic sync when connection restored
6: Conflict resolution for overlapping data
7: Storage limit management (purge old cached data)
8: Manual sync trigger option
9: Sync progress indicator
10: Tests verify no data loss scenarios

## Story 4.3: Data Synchronization Service

As a developer,
I want reliable data synchronization between devices and cloud,
so that all data is eventually consistent.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Sync service handles batch uploads efficiently
2: Deduplication prevents duplicate records
3: Compression reduces bandwidth usage
4: Retry logic for failed syncs
5: Sync status webhooks for monitoring
6: Delta sync for partial updates
7: Rate limiting prevents overload
8: Audit trail for sync operations
9: Performance metrics tracked

## Story 4.4: Session Data API

As a developer,
I want RESTful and GraphQL APIs for session data,
so that clients can query historical performance.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: GraphQL schema for flexible queries
2: REST endpoints for common operations
3: Pagination for large result sets
4: Filtering by date, athlete, metrics
5: Aggregation queries (averages, totals)
6: Response caching for performance
7: API documentation auto-generated
8: Rate limiting per API key
9: Query performance <200ms for common requests

## Story 4.5: Data Export Capabilities

As a coach,
I want to export session data,
so that I can perform additional analysis in external tools.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Export individual sessions as CSV
2: Bulk export for date ranges
3: Include all PM5 metrics in export
4: Formatted for Excel compatibility
5: Export queue for large requests
6: Email notification when ready
7: Temporary download links (24 hour expiry)
8: Export audit trail
9: Rate limiting to prevent abuse

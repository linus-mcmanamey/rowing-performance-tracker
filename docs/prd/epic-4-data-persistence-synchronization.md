# Epic 4: Data Persistence & Synchronization

Implement SwiftData + CloudKit architecture for reliable local storage with automatic cloud synchronization and offline capabilities. This epic ensures no training data is lost and provides the foundation for historical analysis and progress tracking through Apple's native ecosystem.

## Story 4.1: SwiftData + CloudKit Integration

As a developer,
I want to implement SwiftData with CloudKit synchronization,
so that all rowing performance data is reliably persisted and synchronized.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: SwiftData @Model classes configured for all data entities
2: CloudKit container configured for private database sync
3: ModelContainer configured with CloudKit store
4: Automatic schema migration support implemented
5: Data model versioning strategy documented
6: CloudKit sync conflicts resolution implemented
7: Performance testing with 100+ concurrent local inserts
8: CloudKit sync monitoring via OSLog
9: iCloud account requirement handling

## Story 4.2: Offline Mode Implementation

As an athlete,
I want my session data saved locally when offline,
so that I don't lose workouts due to connectivity issues.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: SwiftData local storage works offline by default
2: Session data persisted locally during CloudKit outage
3: CloudKit sync status indicator in UI
4: SwiftData automatic retry for failed CloudKit sync
5: Automatic sync when iCloud connection restored
6: CloudKit conflict resolution using server record wins
7: Local storage management via SwiftData automatic cleanup
8: Manual sync trigger via CloudKit fetch operations
9: Sync progress indicator using CloudKit operation progress
10: Tests verify no data loss with airplane mode scenarios

## Story 4.3: Cross-Device Data Synchronization

As an athlete,
I want my data synchronized across all my Apple devices,
so that I can access my rowing history anywhere.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: CloudKit handles automatic batch sync efficiently
2: SwiftData @Attribute(.unique) prevents duplicate records
3: CloudKit compression reduces bandwidth usage automatically
4: CloudKit automatic retry logic for failed operations
5: CloudKit sync status monitoring via CKSyncEngine (iOS 17+)
6: CloudKit delta sync for partial updates automatically
7: CloudKit rate limiting handled automatically
8: CloudKit operation audit via OSLog
9: CloudKit sync metrics tracked via CloudKit Console

## Story 4.4: SwiftData Query Interface

As a developer,
I want SwiftData @Query interface for session data,
so that UI can efficiently query historical performance.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: @Query predicates for flexible data filtering
2: SwiftData relationships for common operations
3: FetchDescriptor with limits for large result sets
4: Predicate filtering by date, athlete, metrics
5: Aggregate calculations using Swift reduce operations
6: Local query caching via SwiftData automatically
7: SwiftData query documentation with examples
8: @Query performance optimizations with indexes
9: Query performance <100ms for common local requests

## Story 4.5: Data Export Capabilities

As a coach,
I want to export session data,
so that I can perform additional analysis in external tools.

### Acceptance Criteria
1: Export individual sessions as CSV using SwiftData queries
2: Bulk export for date ranges via @Query predicates
3: Include all PM5 metrics from SwiftData models
4: CSV formatted for Excel compatibility
5: Background export using Swift concurrency
6: Share sheet integration for exporting files
7: Files app integration for export management
8: Export operations logged via OSLog
9: Export frequency limits via UserDefaults tracking

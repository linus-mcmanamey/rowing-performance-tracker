# Rowing Performance Tracker

A comprehensive rowing performance tracking platform that connects iOS devices to PM5 rowing machines via Bluetooth for real-time data capture, analysis, and coaching insights.

## üéØ Project Overview

The Rowing Performance Tracker is designed to bridge the gap between PM5 rowing machines and modern performance analytics. It provides athletes and coaches with real-time performance data, historical analysis, and multi-athlete monitoring capabilities.

### Key Features

- **Real-time PM5 Connectivity**: Direct Bluetooth connection to Concept2 PM5 monitors
- **Live Performance Tracking**: Track stroke rate, split times, distance, and power output
- **Athlete Dashboard**: Individual performance metrics and workout history
- **Coach Dashboard**: Multi-athlete monitoring and team management (Phase 2)
- **Historical Analytics**: Performance trends and improvement tracking
- **Cross-Platform Sync**: Data synchronization across devices (Phase 2)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project uses a monorepo structure with clear separation of concerns:

```

### Technology Stack

- **iOS**: Swift 5.5+, SwiftUI, iOS 15.0+
- **Bluetooth**: Core Bluetooth with PM5 GATT protocol
- **Backend**: Node.js/Express with GraphQL (Phase 2)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with real-time sync (Phase 2)
- **Web**: React/Next.js for coach dashboard (Phase 2)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 14.0+
- iOS device or simulator (iOS 15.0+)
- PM5-equipped rowing machine (for full functionality)
- macOS 12.0+ (for development)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/linus-mcmanamey/rowing-performance-tracker.git
   cd rowing-performance-tracker
   ```

2. **Open iOS project**
   ```bash
   open ios-app/d_n_w.xcodeproj
   ```

3. **Build and run**
   - Select your target device/simulator
   - Press `Cmd+R` to build and run
   - Grant Bluetooth permissions when prompted

### First Launch

1. **Grant Bluetooth Permission**: The app will request Bluetooth access for PM5 connectivity
2. **Navigate to PM5 Tab**: Use the PM5 tab to scan for nearby rowing machines
3. **Connect to PM5**: Select your PM5 device from the scan results
4. **Start Rowing**: Begin your workout and watch real-time metrics

## üì± iOS App Structure

### Core Components

- **HomeView**: Main dashboard with quick actions and status
- **PM5TestView**: Bluetooth connection and real-time data display
- **PerformanceView**: Analytics and historical data
- **SettingsView**: App configuration and preferences

### PM5 Integration

The app includes a complete PM5 Bluetooth Low Energy implementation:

- **PM5Controller**: Main BLE connection manager
- **CSAFEProtocol**: CSAFE command protocol implementation
- **PM5DataParser**: Real-time data parsing and processing
- **PM5DataModels**: Structured data models for metrics

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Unit Tests
Cmd+U in Xcode

# Specific test suite
xcodebuild test -scheme d_n_w -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'
```

### Test Coverage

- Target: 80% code coverage
- Focus areas: PM5 connectivity, data parsing, UI components
- Mock BLE services for testing without hardware

## üìñ Development Guide

### Code Standards

- **Swift Style**: Follow Swift API Design Guidelines
